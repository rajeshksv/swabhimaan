                The central and state governments in India promise mandatory and
                free primary education to all children through public schools.
                However the physical and teacher quality at these schools in
                Bangalore are so poor that they act as little more than mid-day
                meal outlets for most kids. Teachers are underpaid,
                under-qualified and frequently absent.

                Several private schools have sprung up within the slums to fill
                this need. In spite of the many challenges they face, these
                schools are considered a better alternative by parents. However,
                most have trouble paying the average annual tuition fee of
                around Rs 8000. Most families have to choose between their kidsâ€™
                education and other pressing needs. Forced drop outs due to
                financial difficulties are all too common.

                Swabhimaan helps parents meet this challenge by extending
                financial aid to the best students. To best utilize our limited
                resources, we conduct diagnostic tests in english, science, math
                and civics just before the start of each school year. Close to
                1000 students turn up for these, of which the top 100 kids are
                are supported in the form of tuition reimbursement.
