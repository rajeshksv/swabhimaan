                    The central and state governments in India promise mandatory
                    and free primary education to all children through public
                    schools. However the physical and teacher quality at these
                    schools in Bangalore are so poor that they act as little
                    more than mid-day meal outlets for most kids. Teachers are
                    underpaid, under-qualified and frequently absent.

                    Several private schools have sprung up within the slums to
                    fill this need. In spite of the many challenges they face,
                    these schools are considered a better alternative by
                    parents. However, most have trouble paying the average
                    annual tuition fee of around Rs 8000. Most families have to
                    choose between their kidsâ€™ education and other pressing
                    needs. Forced drop outs due to financial difficulties are
                    all too common.

                    Swabhimaan helps parents meet this challenge by extending
                    financial aid to the best students. To best utilize our
                    limited resources, we conduct diagnostic tests in english,
                    science, math and civics just before the start of each
                    school year. Close to 1000 students turn up for these, of
                    which the top 100 kids are are supported in the form of
                    tuition reimbursement.
